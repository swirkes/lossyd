# is a speculative daemon
that facilitates interactions between human and non-human entities. Currently, lossyd is centered around the [[2.4 GHz Wi-Fi Band]] and the data streams that traverse it. A couple of notes on the name lossyd:

- "d" denotes daemon, which in computer science refers to a background process that runs on a computer, often performing tasks without the user's direct involvement. A common example is a [Mailer Daemon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounce_message).
 - [[Daemon]] ([Ancient Greek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Greek "Ancient Greek"): δαίμων, "god", "godlike", "power", "fate") a supernatural being working in the background as an intermediary.
 - Lossy sampling refers to compressing audio/image data and discarding some of the data to save space, resulting in lower quality but smaller files. The name is an homage to all the data that is lost in compression.

Speculation stems from the desire to fully give up control of lossyd's operation, but being unable to. Though there are programmed elements, it doesn't function as a typical computer daemon program. The possibility of a meaningful exchange between a human and the air pressure variations via audible sound is open to interpretation.

## lossyp

an e.p. of processed recordings from the [[2.4 GHz Wi-Fi Band]]. Designed as a proof of concept, they were created by using an [RTL-SDR](https://rtl-sdr.com) dongle connected to a [dipole antenna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dipole_antenna), 6 cm on each side.

## Implementation

Using an [RTL-SDR](https://www.rtl-sdr.com) dongle and a bipolar antenna, about 6 cm long, different methods produced different results. Direct Sampling was engaged in order to reach the super-high frequency bands. The most lively results came from using I/Q sampling with a 10k bandwidth and then tuning into different data streams. 

The sound seems very static, however, when resonance effects are added, the microchanges in sound are amplified and more easily discerned.
